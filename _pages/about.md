I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [department of fysik, kemi och biologi (IFM)](https://liu.se/organisation/liu/ifm) at [Link√∂ping University, Sweden](https://liu.se/). My research is at the junction of biology, statistics and machine learning. I work with Prof. Bjorn Wallner, who has worked in computational modelling of protein ensembles. I am funded by the Wenner-Gren foundation via my postodoctoral grant to work on investigating the conformational landscape of flexible protiens.

Previously, I obtained my doctorate from [Indian Institute of Techology Delhi, New Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) in September 2023. My thesis aimed at employing representation learning to [Prof. Durai Sundar](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~sundar/index.html)

Before joining IIT Delhi, I did my Batchelor's of Techology (B.Tech.) in Biotechnology from GB Pant University, Uttrakahnd, India. My project under the supervision of Prof. [Sanjeev Agarwal](https://gbpuat.ac.in/colleges/CBSH/D1/sanjeev_profile.html) was aimed to identification and profiling of the anti-microbial effected of steroidal lactones from Withania Somnifera.
