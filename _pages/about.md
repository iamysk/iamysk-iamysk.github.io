I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Bioinformatics division (BIOIN)](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/ifm/bioin) at [Link√∂ping University, Sweden](https://liu.se/) under the supervison of Prof. Bjorn Wallner, who specializes in computational modelling of protein ensembles. Our research is at the junction of biology, statistics and machine learning. I am also funded by the Wenner-Gren foundation via my postodoctoral grant to work on investigating the conformational landscape of flexible protiens.

Previously, I obtained my doctorate from [Indian Institute of Techology Delhi, New Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) in 2023 unde rthe supervison of [Prof. Durai Sundar](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~sundar/index.html). My thesis was aimed at developing solutions that effectively integrate diverse biological datasets to aid prognosis modelling and drug discovery. I worked with NGS datasets of Lung adenorcinoma (LUAD) and Breast cancer (BRCA) to develop models in survival prediction. 


Before joining IIT Delhi, I did my Batchelor's of Techology (B.Tech.) in Biotechnology from GB Pant University, Uttrakahnd, India. My project under the supervision of Prof. [Sanjeev Agarwal](https://gbpuat.ac.in/colleges/CBSH/D1/sanjeev_profile.html) was aimed to identification and profiling of the anti-microbial effected of steroidal lactones from Withania Somnifera.
